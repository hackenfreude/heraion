# What
A [json-schema](http://json-schema.org) **validator** in Scala.

# Why
Because the world needs another library, and this sounded fun.

# Heraion?
Naming things is difficult. More backstory to come.

# Which json-schema?
For now, draft-06. But I have aspirations.

# Can I Use This In Production?
It doesn't really validate anything (yet), so probably not.
